Multi Docker

An interactice web app which is unreasonably complicated with a Nginx server for rerouting, a react server to host production files,
an Express server to connect to two seperate databases (Redis and Postgres) for storing values.
Everything is wrapped up nicely in a Docker Ecosystem with Docker-compose functionality and integrated Travis CI support for easy 
deployment.
